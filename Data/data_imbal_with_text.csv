handheld condenser mics are rugged and capable of taking the rigors of field use but a dynamic mic is even less likely to be damaged by rough handling the downside is dynamic mics have less output level so they tend to produce more hiss in recordings one basic rule of recording is that the recording cannot possibly produce better sound quality than the microphone is capable of delivering recording quality begins with the microphone the other significant consideration is the mic preamp many preamps use chips and capacitors that have noise and distortion that is not low enough to produce high quality results the greater the difference between the microphones signal and the residual noise of the preamp the better the results will be interview microphones typically produce output levels down at db to db therefore you need microphone preamp noise and distortion to be as low as possible to increase the difference between the signal and the noise this is known as maximizing the signal to noise ratio often listed as sn remember the preamp amplifies both the desirable signal and the undesirable noise plus distortion basic microphone types long shotgun microphones are typically most useful for recording sound in noisy environments or when you cannot place the microphone close to the source long shotguns typically have very good off axis rejection that is they hear only what they are aimed at  a practical concern of using long shotguns is that they are physically very long this makes them pretty much impossible to handle without a person whos only job is to position the microphone short shotgun microphones are smaller versions of the long shotgun  besides being physically smaller than a long shotgun most short shotguns offer a somewhat wider pickup pattern which makes them easier on the journalist who has to both operated the gear and do the interview the short shotgun is probably the most commonly used microphone in location sound recording but is best left to the experienced user for interviews supercardioid  hypercardioid microphones have a pickup pattern between a cardioid and a shotgun they have more off axis rejection than a cardioid but not as narrow a pickup pattern as a short shotgun these have a more natural open sound than the shotguns and are typically easier to use as they do not have to be pointed as precisely as a shotgun cardioid microphones have a hemispherical pickup pattern the cardioid is more effective for picking up a larger group of speakers at one time a cardioid mic is also the easiest for a interviewer to use as it can remain stationary allowing the user to concentrate on the subject not the microphone a cardioid microphone has very little sound pickup directly behind the microphone but it does pickup sounds on the far sides of the microphone an added benefit of all three cardioid types is they generally are physically shorter this makes the microphone easier to use in tight spaces a cardioid interview mic held between the interviewer and subject pointed up will do a good job of hearing both and eliminate the need to move the mic rapid microphone movement can be detectable and distracting omnidirectional microphones have a spherical pickup pattern that is the they pick up sounds equally well in any direction this characteristic makes them relatively immune to windnoise and less susceptible to handling noise but also means they will hear every sound in the area this makes them difficult to use indoors or in a noisy environment in these situations they need to be very close to the sound source to produce clean results omnis are the most commonly used interview mic and the most natural sounding that is they produce the least coloration or tonal alteration of the sound the downside is they do a poor job of isolating the subject and so can produce noisy results indoors outdoors they are the pickup pattern of choice oral history recording lavalier microphones are the small microphones worn by talking heads on television to do very good quality recordings of inexperienced speakers while seated consider using a lav mic like the akg c audiotechnica at or my favorite the dpa  a lav mic is best for seated interviews for  reasons first the subject does not need to know how to stay on mic they can turn their heads move around and generally be comfortable second as the subject does not see the mic they quickly forget they are being recorded the interview then becomes a one on one conversation with another person something we are all comfortable with and for this reason you get better content an added plus is as the mic is close to the speaker unwanted background noises are not as audible low cost lav mics are not only noisy but more susceptible to the sound of clothes moving so buy a professional qualify lav mic  recommended microphones  eng  interviews hand held condensers unidirectional  cad c maudio aries audiotechnica ur or atm akg ceb

surprisingly good but cannot replace a high grade external mic the sony pcmd is the only exception some solo journalist on a tight budget or that need to minimize the gear they are carrying use them for interviews secondary ambient sounds note taking and the like with good results they can be used to record some ambience before or after an interview to use in post production to enhance the interview this can add interest and flavor to improve the listeners experience without the need for additional gear built in microphones are also useful for impromptu recordings and can make the difference between capturing an unexpected event or missing it for musicians they are nice for recording practice sessions or friends playing for fun recording these just for fun sessions can sometimes result in discovering new ways to play a familiar song  there are many imaginative uses for built in microphones just remember their limitations how do i choose a microphone for nature or ambient recordings  one basic rule of recording is that the recording cannot possibly produce better sound quality than the microphone is capable of delivering recording quality begins with the microphone condenser mics generally provide a higher output signal level and this is essential for recording ambient or nature sounds  if you start off with a higher signal level you end up with a bigger difference between the sound you want and the noises and distortion you do not want ie you hear less noise the microphone output level is found in the microphones specification it is listed as sensitivity it is usually measured in mvpa the the larger the number the higher the output level of the microphone all other things being equal a higher output mic will produce lower noise in your recording the other specification to consider is signal to noise ratio this is listed as sn again the larger the number the lower the noise condenser microphones also have a lighter diaphragm that allows them to be more responsive to the subtle vibrations in the air produced by ambient or nature sounds and this gives them more clarity and detailed for isolating a single sound like a specific insect animal or bird one of two options work best first is the shotgun mic they are highly directional and have very good off axis rejection that is they hear only what they are aimed at a high output low noise long shotgun does a very good job of isolating the sound you want from other sounds in the area a short shotgun microphone is physically smaller than a long shotgun most short shotguns offer a somewhat wider pickup pattern which means they will pickup a bit more sound off axis this can be useful if your target sound is on the move the audiotechnica at r is a great choice for a low cost high output low noise mic as is the sennheiser me the sennheiser mkh  and schoeps cmit u are exceptional high quality shotgun mics the schoeps not only works well for typical shotgun applications but also has such a natural sound it works very well for samples fx and even music a parabola is a dish shaped device that not only helps isolate a specific sound but provides some gain or amplification of that signal without adding noise a well made parabola can be used with either a mono or stereo microphone however stereo performance with a parabola is very limited compared with a conventional stereo mic setup telinga makes a very good parabolic reflector if your goal is to record a very natural sounding ambient space a shotgun mic is not the right choice for this type of recording there are  good options one is using  small diaphragm omnidirectional mics mounted on a baffle jecklin disc or dummy head this produces a realistic d sound when listening on headphones the sound can be somewhat flat or lacking depth if played back on most stereo systems the other three options do very well for playback on  speakers as well as headphones an xy pattern using cardioids or figure of eight microphones works best without a doubt the most spacious and natural sound is obtained with the classic blumlein or figure of eight stereo microphone technique a  degree xy cardioid setup is close but is not as spacious nor does it render as much information behind the listener the ms technique is another option for doing nature or ambient recordings this typically requires processing the signal with a matrix either within the microphone or after the fact for this reason it may not produce as transparent a sound as a recording made with microphones that require no processing if you have the choice analog signal processing usually produces more realistic results doing the ms decoding on a computer can sound harsh or result in reduced depth  bit or higher processing is recommended if stereo is decoded in the microphone transformers are typically used and this results in very low output signal levels a poor choice when recording soft sounds finding a good stereo microphone for recording ambient spaces is very helpful as it reduces the amount of gear you need to carry as well as simplifies setup the akg c or dpa  make great choices for binaural recordings while the audiotechnica bp or the beyer dynamic ck stereo pair are good choices for ambient and nature recordings dpa schoeps and sennheiser make a wide range of high output low noise high quality mics that work very well recording soft sounds stereo recording techniques this is a review of the different techniques used to record ambient sounds
and concerts in stereo i will cover common configurations using two three and four
microphones all of these methods have produced satisfying results the
sound source recording environment and the desired effect determine which
of these techniques should be used  history  shotgun microphones  coincident techniques  crossed figure of eight techniques  xy cardioid  hypercardioid techniques  ms techniques  streicherhealy techniques  near coincident techniques  binaural techniques  spaced microphone techniques  three and four microphone techniques  basic suggestions  how do i set up my microphones  i hope that this enhances the quality of the recordings that you create  please let me know if you have any further questions or if you feel that i may have overlooked an important aspect of live sound tapers section oade brothers audio tapers section  copyright    oade  brothers audio all rights reserved"
